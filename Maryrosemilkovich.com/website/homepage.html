    <h1>Welcome to my website</h1>
    <h2>My attempt to organize and understand my world.</h2>
    <p>Join me as I record, review, and reconcile my experiences, skill development, and insights. My objective is to bring an intention to my growth and learning. I'm building this for myself, though I welcome any pageviews that aren't my own.</p>

    <p>Here are some things I hope to incorporate</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Writings about human management, product management, dog training, tiny home living, and more!</li>
      <li>Catalogs of my skill development in areas like HTML/CSS, customer interviews, and emotional intelligence.</li>
      <li>Projects, both successful and not.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Get the gist? What to dive in? <a class="text-link" href="/Users/mmilkovich/Desktop/Maryrosemilkovich.com/website/start-here.html"> Start here.</a></p>
