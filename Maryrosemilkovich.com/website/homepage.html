    <h1>Welcome to my website</h1>
    <h2>My attempt to organize and understand my world.</h2>
    <p>Join me as I record, review, and reconcile my experiences, skills, and insights. My objective is to bring an intention to my growth and learning. I'm building this for myself, though I welcome any pageviews that aren't my own.</p>

    <p>Here are some things I hope to incorporate</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Thoughts about human management, product management, dog training, tiny home living, and more!</li>
      <li>Catalogs of my skill development in areas like HTML/CSS, customer interviews, and emotional intelligence.</li>
      <li>Projects, both successful and not.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Get the gist? What to dive in? <a class="text-link" href="https://mmilkovich.github.io/Maryrosemilkovich.com/website/start-here.html"> Start here >></a></p>

    <h2>A note about the design and development of this website</h2>

    <p>As noted above, this website is produced by me, for me. It's an experiment for me to build my web dev and design know-how. I don't take it too seriously, and I hope no one else will either.</p>
